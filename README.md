# Heart-Attack-Prediction

A heart attack (cardiovascular disease) happens when the passage of blood to the heart muscle is unexpectedly blocked. According to WHO figures, 17.9 million people die each year from a heart attack. According to the medical study, human lifestyle is the primary cause of this heart disease. Aside from that, there are other significant markers that indicate whether or not a person is at risk of suffering a heart attack.
